# i am going to an hackathon, our project domain is sustainable energy. Our project is about ML model for continuous monitoring of the home appliances 
# with respect to the unit consumption so that we could send alerts to the user for any short time break off for saving electricity and thus also reducing the electricity bill.
#
# now i am responsible for creating a a basic front end for this. 
# the front end should include the thing like the appliance name, wattage and duration for which it is kept on. 
# Also there should be a section for adding older electricity bills so that the ML model can review them and give suggestion for saving electricity accordingly. 
# Now i am planning to make this front end using streamlit and python. 
# Your task is to make me a good front end, it should be catchy but professional looking. 
# I want a basic 3 compulsory appliances field and have a plus button so that user can add multiple appliances.
